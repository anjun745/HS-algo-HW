If the chart improves, keep the swap, if it does not, undo the swap.  This approach is called \"Hill Climbing\" because you are always making choices that can only improve the score, but never make it lower.  This approach DOES NOT guarantee the BEST possible seating chart, however.\n​\nFor Part 2: \n​\n1. Write code to loop through every student in order and swap them with every other student one at a time (This is $On^2$ but on a relatively small data set, this is not a problem)\n2.

If you assume that people work best sitting by or near people they like, then it's important to maximize the number of students working with or near people they want to work with.  The goal is to maximize the happiness, thereby maximizing the learning.\n\nThe job of this assignment is to create a tool that creates the best possible seating chart given a class of students and their best and worst neighbors.\n\nThe class has 16 tables with 2 students at each table.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b04303","input":"### Day 3, Part 2, The Genetic Algorithm\n​\nIn this part, you'll use the concept of a Genetic Algorithm to \"EVOLVE\" a better schedule.  In the natural world, species evolve over a period of generations to adapt and be successful in their given environment.  This evolution occurs through a process of natural selection -- animals that are not well suited will die off, and those that are better suited for their environment thrive and pass on their genes to the next generation.\n​\nThis same process can be used as an algorithm to \"evolve\" solutions to problems whenever you have an objective function to compare one solution to another, as we have with our Seating Chart total_score.\n​\nHere is how will implement this approach.\n​\n1. Create a \"population\" of randomly generated seating charts along with their score (say 50 or 60 instances created using the \"random_duplicate\" method.  This population of initial schedules make up Generation 1\n​\nLOOP THIS PART for n GENERATIONS:\n​\n2. Order all the seating charts in the generation from best to worst score.\n3. Eliminate the lowest scoring half of the seating chart and duplicate the best scoring half\n4. Save the current best schedule so it doesn't get lost.\n5. \"mutate\" every schedule in the population and update the score ... if the best score is lower than the saved best schedule then insert that schedule back into the population (you don't want the best schedule lost from the population)\n6. This is your new generation ... sort that generation and do it again for n generations .... \n​\n​\nWith this process, your seating chart score should evolve with each generation.  This is not a \"fast\" algorithm, but it is an amazing way to approach some very complicated problems and you have a way to rank solutions with an objective function.\n​\nOnce you get the above working, make sure you have some way of demonstrating or visualizing the \"evoluation\" of your schedule.  For example, you could print the new score whenever the evolution creates a new best schedule.  Or you could graph the best score in every generation using Matplotlib to give you an idea when you may be arriving at near the best schedule possible.\n​\nAlso, print the score and the visual seating chart of your best schedule.  If it is VERY good, also save the seating chart to a file so we can compare best results.","pos":22,"type":"cell"}
