The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n</blockquote>\n\nHints: \n<ol>\n    <li>How do you know when the list is sorted?  When a complete pass through the list produces no swaps.</li>\n    <li>Remember in python, you can do simultaneous assignment, so swapping can be done easily, like this:</li>\n</ol>\n\n```python\na, b = b, a\n# or \nA[1], A[2] = A[2],A[1]\n```\n\nChallenge: Write two different versions, one with loops and one using a loop and recursion.","pos":7,"type":"cell"}
