    "Given an array (a list in Python terminology) of integers, your task is to write a function `palindromic_sort` that returns the array sorted according to the following rules, in this order of priority:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Palindromic numbers (e.g., 121 or 7 or 143341 or -1221) come before all non palindromic numbers.\n",
    "2. After Rule 1, numbers divisible by 3 come before all numbers not divisible by 3\n",
    "3. After 1 & 2, numbers closer to zero come before numbers further from zero on a number line\n",
    "4. In the case of ties, such as -50 and 50, negative numbers come first\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the following list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[-1221, 757, 52, 17, 24, 3, -52]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Would sort to this order\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[3, -1221, 757, 24, 17, -52, 52]\n",
    "```\n",
    "*first 3 numbers are palindromes, but first 2 are divisible by 3, so they come before 757 which is not divisible by 3, then comes 24, which is divisible by 3 but not a palindrome, then 17 and -52 which are not divisible by 3 and not palidromes and 17 is closer to zero than -52.  Lastly 52 comes after -52 according to sort rule 4*\n",
