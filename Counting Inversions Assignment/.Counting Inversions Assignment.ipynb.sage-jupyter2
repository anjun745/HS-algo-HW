{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2aa7fb","input":"## Counting Inversions: Brute Force ($On^2$) and with Divide and Conquer ($O(n\\log n)$)\n\nAn *inversion* in an array is a pair of elements that are \"out of order.\"  For example, every pair of elements in an array where the earlier element is larger than the later element is considered an inversion.\n\nFor example, in this array\n```\n1 3 5 2 4 6\n```\nThere are 3 inversions, (3,2), (5,2) and (5,4)\n\n\nYour job will be to write two functions to count the number of inversions in an array of numbers.\n\n### But Why Would We Want to Do This\nOne of the primary uses of counting inversions is to provide a quantitative measure of the similarity between two lists.  The fewer number of inversions, the more similar are those lists.  This is actually a key idea when doing **Collabartive Filtering** -- a technique for generating recommendations.  If, for example, Netflix knew your 100 favorite movies or tv shows, they could find other people with very similar lists and make recommendations based on what they have watched, but you haven't. Very effective and useful, don't you agree?\n\n\n\n## Counting Inversions\n## Part 1: Brute Force\n\nFirst watch this video explaining the idea of Counting Inversions in an array:\n\n[Video 1: Understanding Inversions (12 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_AJfusC6UQ&list=PLEGCF-WLh2RLHqXx6-GZr_w7LgqKDXxN_&index=13)\n\n\nOne method for finding the inversions is with a double for loop through the array, comparing each number to all those that follow, and counting each inversion as it arises.  Your first function will use this \"Brute Force\" approach.  In part 2, you'll try another approach to do better than the $On^2$ performance of this approach\n","pos":0,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a58ac9","input":"## Part 2: Doing Better with Divide and Conquer\n\nNow that we are familiar with the powerful divide and conquer approach from MergeSort, Binary Search, and Quicksort, we can use this skill to count inversions in $O(n\\log(n))$\n\nTo do this, the \"divide\" step will be exactly as we implemented in MergeSort, with one recursive call for the left half and one for the right.\n\nFor implementation Details, watch the following Tim Roughgarden video:\n\n[Video 2: Counting Split Inversions using Merge Sort Approach (17 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ygiW8xN7Y&list=PLEGCF-WLh2RLHqXx6-GZr_w7LgqKDXxN_&index=14)\n\nWrite your version of the `count_split_inversions` function below.","pos":4,"type":"cell"}
