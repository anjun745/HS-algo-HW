    "### Depth First Search -- DFS \n",
    "\n",
    "**Depth First Search (DFS)**, as the name implies seeks to aggressively search deep into a graph, only backtracking when it can go no further or all nodes along a path have been explored.  Just like BFS, DFS will find all the nodes that are findable from a given starting point of a graph in linear O(m+n) time.  DFS, however, is uniquely suited for finding Topological Ordering of a directed graph and for finding the Strongly Connected Components of directed acyclic graphs -- applications which BFS cannot do.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use BFS and DFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use BFS for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - finding shortest paths between nodes\n",
    "    - solutons are rare, but shallow in graphs\n",

    "\n",
    "    - finding Strongly Connected Components of directed graphs\n",
    "    - finding a topological ordering of directed acyclic graphs\n",
    "    - searching for solutions to mazes\n",
    "    - when solutions are plentiful but deep within graphs\n",
    "    \n",

    "    - finding Connected Components of undirected Graph\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Today you are going to Code 2 versions of DFS to find all the findable nodes of an undirected graph.  You'll code a recursive version making use of the \"call stack\" to aggressively search the edges of any new nodes, and you'll do an iterative (looping) version that makes use of a Stack data structure with the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle."

    "### Part 2: Connected Components of Undirected Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A connected component of a graph consists of all the elements that can be reached from a given starting point.  If there are two nodes that not connected by any path in an undirected graph, then these nodes must be part of different Connected Components.\n",
    "\n",
    "A connected component can be thought of as an island of nodes that are not connected to the other nodes of a given graph.  For example, in the 4_letter_word_graph you created, the following 3 words constitute a connected component of the graph: `{'AMBO', 'UMBO', 'AMMO'}`  Those three words are connected to each other, but there is NO path from these words to any other words in the 4_letter_word_graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since DFS and BFS will both find all the findable nodes from a given starting node, to find the Connected Components of a graph, you only need embed DFS or BFS inside of a loop of all the nodes of a graph, keeping track of all the nodes you've seen so far and calling DFS or BFS on each node that has not been seen already.\n",
