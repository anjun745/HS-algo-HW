Then using the amount of pairs remaining, join the first half of pairs into quads by adding the smallest elements from the pairs first, then the second half, then do the same with the quads, and since we know the smallest will be in the front, this method is to work for sure. The real difference between this method and the normal merge sort is that this method skips the splitting part which could speed up the process as the length of the list increases.\n",
