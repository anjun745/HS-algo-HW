{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1c86bc","input":"#### Exercise 2: Merge Sort Algorithm\n\nMerge Sort is a classic algorithm that is our first sorting algorithm to actually run faster than $O(n^2)$\n\nYour task is to write a recursive function called `merge_sort` that takes in an unsorted list and returns a sorted list of the same elements.\n\nBefore you begin, watch and **take notes** on this Tim Roughgarden video explaining 1) the pseudocode of how merge sort works, 2) an analysis of the run time and 3) a refresher on logorithms:\n\n[Tim Roughgarden PseudoCode and Analysis of MergeSort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBd5w0rQaFo)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Merge Sort Pic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Merge-Sort-Tutorial.png)","pos":4,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"627e00","input":"### Binary Search Algorithm\n\nIf you have ever played a guessing game where you guess a number between 1 and 100, you know it's a lot easier to guess the answer if they say \"higher\" or \"lower\" after you guess.\n\nIn fact, if you are clever about your next guess, you can reduce your average number of guesses from $O(n)$ to the much faster $O\\log_2(n)$\n\nThis is the \"Binary Guessing Strategy\": your next guess should always be as close to halfway between the remaining possible numbers.  If you were playing [\"Guess Who\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRlbNOno5VA) you'd want to try to eliminate half of the characters on each turn.\n\nIf you have a sorted list, you can use this strategy to very quickly determine if a given number is in the list.  The technique is called a **Binary Search** over a sorted list.\n\nTo conduct a binary search, divide the list in half and then recursively do a binary search over the half of the list that could contain the number you are looking for until you are down to just a single number.\n\n**Exercise 1** involves coding a recursive binary search over a sorted list, so you can avoid the embarrassing mistake Richard is reminded of in [this meeting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmHZMiohXVM) \n","pos":0,"type":"cell"}
