{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"41035f","input":"### Part 2: Test Cases\n\nThere are 3 test graphs and solutions for you to check your work.  The graphs are saved as files of the format of one line for each edge from v -> w.  The nodes are numbered from 1 to N with N being the number in the name of the file.  For example:\n\nThe file named \"input_scc_800.txt\" has 800 nodes.  The first lines of the file look like this:\n```\n1 34\n1 459\n1 647\n2 782\n3 278\n```\nThis means that node 1 points to 34, 459 and 647.\n\n\nRemember, these are directed graphs, so the nodes do not necessarily go in both directions, though they could.\n\nThe \"answer\" or output for each test case is provided in the corresponding \"output\" file.  So, the answer you should get for \"input_scc_800.txt\" is in the file \"output_scc_800.txt\"\n\nThe 3 test graphs are:\n\n    1) input_scc_32.txt -> output_scc_32.txt\n    2) input_scc_800.txt -> output_scc_800.txt\n    3) input_scc_20000.txt -> output_scc_20000.txt\n\n    4) input_scc_320000.txt -> the test case I'll use for grading\n    \n   \nRemember, you sare returning the SIZE of the 5 largest SCC's in each graph.","pos":4,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5fc011","input":"## Strongly Connected Components of Directed Graphs\n\n**NOTE:** This is likely one of the most challenging assignments of the semester.  Give yourself plenty of time to work on this problem.  Work and talk with your partner and post questions to the #general channel on Slack!\n\n\nIn this assignment, you will implement Kasaraju's 2-pass Depth First Search Algorithm to uncover the Strongly Connected Components (SCC's) of Directed Graphs.\n\nTo implement this algorithm, follow the directions from class lecture and the [Tim Roughgarden Explanation for Computing Strongly Connected Components of Directed Graphs](https://youtu.be/O98hLTYVN3c)\n\nI've provided a small test case that matches the graph used in the video above.  Use this graph as your first test graph as you write your algorithm.\n\nIn the much larger test cases that follow, you will return the size of the 5 largest SCCs in the given graphs.\n\nNOTE: because the test cases include some VERY large graphs, you should not use the recursive version of DFS, as it will surpass the allowed recursion depth.\n\nNOTE 2: The graph described in the video is a slightly different format than the Adjacency List dictionary we used to represent the Scrabble Graph.  In the given test cases, the nodes are all integers, so the graph could be represented as a list of lists, such as:\n```python\ngr = [[],[4],[8],[6],[7],[2],[9],[1],[5,6],[3,7]]\n```\nWhere the index is the name of the node and the list at that index contains the nodes it is connected to.  If you prefer to use a dictionary, you may do that as well.  I have provided both representations of the graph below for you.  It's up to you which you want to use. ","pos":0,"type":"cell"}
