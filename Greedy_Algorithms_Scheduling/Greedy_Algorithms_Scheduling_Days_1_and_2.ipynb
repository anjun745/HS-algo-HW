    "### Intro to Greedy Algorithms\n",
    "* Assignment inspired from example in *Algorithms Illuminiated Volume 3* by Tim Roughgarden\n",
    "\n",
    "A greedy algorithm is an approach that constructs solutions by making a series of short-sighted decisions based on a \"rule\" and hoping this creates the best solution in the end.  We have already seen one such algorithm in Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm, with the only rule being to add the node that creates the shortest path from the explored nodes to the unexplored.  This simple rule applied over and over until all nodes have been reached results in the correct result of the shortest path from a single node to every other node on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may be easy to come up with a \"rule\" to implement, and it may be that this rule creates a good result, it is often the case the the rule will not necessarily produce the correct or BEST result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving that your rule produces the best result is often very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: A simple Scheduling Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when things need to be sheduled, you have to prioritize which jobs or \"tasks\" to complete first.  This can be true when assigning a computer to do tasks in a certain order, but can also be used in your own life like doing homework or determining the best order for completing the tasks on a to-do list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the process is to determine an **objective function** which gives you a way to evaluate and compare different potential schedules.  To do this, we'll use two ideas:\n",
    "    1. Completion Time of a task\n",
    "    2. The Sum of Weighted Completion Times.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Calculating Completion Times\n",
    "Given a series of tasks of length 1, 2 and 3\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <th>&nbsp;</th>\n",
    "        <th>Task1</th>\n",
    "        <th>Task2</th>\n",
    "        <th>Task3</th>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td>Length</td>\n",
    "        <td>1</td>\n",
    "        <td>2</td>\n",
    "        <td>3</td>\n",

    "        <td>6</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The completion time of a task is the time elapsed before the task is complete.  So, task 1 is complete after 1 minute, but task 2 must wait for task 1 to finish before it can start, so its completion time is 1 + 2 = 3 minutes.  Similarly, task 3 must wait for both 1 and 2 to finish, so its completion time is 1+2+3 = 6.  The sum of these completion times would be 10 minutes.  If you reversed the order however, your completion times would be 3, then 5 then 6, for a total of 14.  Clearly, scheduling the shortest tasks first makes for a better schedule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, some tasks are usually more important than others.  This can be determined by a weight or priority.  The higher the weight of the task, the more important it is.  In this case, the goal of a good schedule is to minimize the sum of the weighted completion times, or equivalently, minimizing the average weighted completion time.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, given 3 tasks with completion times and weights:\n",
